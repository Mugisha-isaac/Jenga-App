**User & Market Requirements**

The approved problem for this project focuses on the limited sharing of local innovations among
communities in Rwanda. Although individuals often create effective solutions to common challenges,
such as new farming techniques or resource-saving methods, these ideas rarely reach beyond their
immediate areas. As a result, many communities face similar issues in isolation, without benefiting
from each other's experiences. This is particularly significant in Rwanda, where smallholder farmers
make up around 83% of the agricultural workforce but often lack access to modern practices and
information (Rwanda Development Board).

The domain of the project lies in technology-enabled knowledge sharing, aiming to bridge this gap.
The project's main objective is to develop **"Jenga,"** a user-friendly mobile application that enables
Rwandans to document and share local solutions, search for relevant innovations, connect with other
users, and foster a national culture of collaboration and self-reliance. Through this initiative, the
project seeks to promote faster problem-solving, economic resilience, and grassroots-driven
development across Rwandan communities.


**Persona Card**



**Main Cases**

**Case 1** : Jean-Baptiste Niyonzima, a 34-year-old smallholder farmer and cooperative leader
from Musanze District, Northern Province, represents the ideal Jenga primary user. Despite
completing only primary school, Jean-Baptiste has developed innovative water conservation
techniques that have improved his yields by 35% on his 2.1-hectare diversified farm. He
actively participates in his local cooperative, mentors younger farmers, and seeks digital
solutions to connect with farmers beyond his immediate community. With the proposed Jenga
app, Jean-Baptiste would be able to document and share his proven farming techniques, such
as his successful intercropping methods for beans, maize, sweet potatoes, and vegetables. His
comfort with smartphone usage and mobile apps would make him an early adopter who could
demonstrate the platform's value to other cooperative members and help build the
knowledge-sharing network that Jenga aims to create.

**Case 2** : Building on Jean-Baptiste's leadership role, the Jenga app would enable him to
mentor farmers like 28-year-old Agnes Uwimana from his cooperative, who struggle with
crop failure due to poor soil management techniques. Through the platform, Jean-Baptiste
could share step-by-step video tutorials of his soil conservation methods, while Agnes could
ask questions and receive personalized advice. This peer-to-peer knowledge transfer would
address Agnes's need for practical, locally-relevant farming guidance that she cannot access
through formal agricultural extension services. The app would bridge the gap between
experienced farmers like Jean-Baptiste who have developed effective techniques and
emerging farmers who need proven solutions to increase their productivity and food security.

**Case 3** : During monthly Umuganda community work sessions, Jean-Baptiste would use
Jenga to facilitate group innovation-sharing sessions among his cooperative's 150 members.
He could demonstrate how to use the app's photo and video features to document successful
farming practices, while encouraging other members to share their own innovations.
Jean-Baptiste's vision of building a collaborative farming community would be realized


through the app's network features, allowing his cooperative to connect with similar groups
across Northern Province. His success in improving crop yields and his desire for sustainable
farming innovation would make him a natural ambassador for the platform, helping to
establish Jenga as an essential tool for Rwanda's agricultural transformation at the grassroots
level.

**Market Snapshot**

The Total Addressable Market (TAM) includes everyone in Rwanda who has an interest in
agricultural innovation. More than 70 per cent of Rwandans are involved in agriculture, with
the sector contributing more than 26 per cent of the country's Gross Domestic Product (FAO,
2024). With Rwanda's population estimated at over 13 million, this represents approximately
9.1 million potential users. The Serviceable Available Market (SAM) focuses on the 78.
percent mobile phone penetration rate as of 2022, with rural areas varying between 71.9 to
77.6 percent of mobile phone possession (AllAfrica, 2023). This translates to roughly 7.
million farmers with mobile access, though internet penetration stands at 34.4 per cent
(Freedom House, 2024), narrowing our immediate target market to approximately 3.1 million
connected farmers. The competitor gap exists because current platforms like **Agirite** focus
primarily on market connections and formal training, while **Jenga** would uniquely address
the unmet need for peer-to-peer innovation sharing among smallholders. Existing agricultural
apps target market-oriented farmers with established businesses, whereas **Jenga** would serve
the broader community of subsistence and emerging farmers who represent the majority of
Rwanda's agricultural workforce.

**Key Performance Indicators**

Three measurable KPIs would track Jenga's success in democratising agricultural innovation
sharing once developed. First, Monthly Active Users (MAU) would measure platform
engagement, with a target of 50,000 active users within the first year, representing
approximately 1.6% of connected farmers. This metric would be crucial because consistent


usage would indicate that farmers find genuine value in the innovation-sharing features.
Second, Innovation Posts per Month would track content creation, targeting 2,
farmer-generated innovation posts monthly by month 12. This KPI would be essential
because user-generated content is the core value proposition, and high posting rates would
demonstrate that farmers are actively documenting and sharing their innovations. Third, the
Cross-District Innovation Adoption Rate would measure how quickly innovations spread
geographically, with a goal of 25% of popular innovations being adopted across at least three
districts within 60 days of posting. This metric would be vital because it would directly
measure the app's primary intended impact: accelerating the spread of locally-relevant
agricultural innovations across Rwanda's farming communities.
