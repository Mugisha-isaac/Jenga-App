# PayPal Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up PayPal payments in your Jenga App.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. PayPal Developer Account Setup

1. **Create a PayPal Developer Account:**
   - Go to [PayPal Developer Portal](https://developer.paypal.com/)
   - Sign in with your PayPal account or create a new one
   - Navigate to "My Apps & Credentials"

   - Select "Sandbox" for testing or "Live" for production
   - Note down your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Update the `.env` file in your project root with your PayPal credentials:

```env
# Sandbox Credentials (for testing)
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID_SANDBOX=your_sandbox_client_id_here
PAYPAL_SECRET_SANDBOX=your_sandbox_secret_here

# Production Credentials (for live payments)
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID_PRODUCTION=your_production_client_id_here
PAYPAL_SECRET_PRODUCTION=your_production_secret_here

# Environment (set to false for sandbox, true for production)
PAYPAL_IS_PRODUCTION=false
```

### 3. Test the Integration

1. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Test Payment Flow:**
   - Navigate to a premium solution
   - Tap "Pay with PayPal"
   - Use PayPal sandbox test accounts for testing

## 🧪 Testing with Sandbox

### Sandbox Test Accounts

- Password: `password123`

**Test Seller Account:**

- Password: `password123`

### Testing Steps
